## 🎯 Where We Left Off

### Completed
1. **Phase 1: MCP-UI Fundamentals** ✅
   - Learned MCP protocol basics
   - Understood MCP-UI extensions
   - Discovered API documentation mismatches
   - Implemented workaround for UI resource serialization
   - Grasped security model (sandboxed iframes)

2. **Phase 2: Development Environment** ✅
   - Set up monorepo with npm workspaces
   - Created server (MCP + Bridge) and client (React)
   - Configured TypeScript for both
   - Implemented two working demo tools
   - Documented architecture and learning plan

### Next Up
**Phase 3: Build Travel Planner Tools** ⏳

**Immediate tasks:**
1. Define data structures for destinations
2. Create mock destination data
3. Implement `search_destinations` tool (text-based)
4. Implement `get_destination_info` tool (text-based)
5. Implement `create_itinerary` tool (text-based)

---

## 💡 Key Decisions Made

### Architecture
- **Monorepo structure:** Separate server/client folders with workspaces
- **Bridge pattern:** Express server translates HTTP to stdio
- **UI serialization:** Embed JSON in text with `UI_RESOURCE:` prefix
- **Security:** Sandboxed iframes with `allow-scripts` only

### Technology
- **Server:** Node.js + TypeScript + Express
- **Client:** React 19 + Vite + TypeScript
- **MCP:** @modelcontextprotocol/sdk v1.20.2
- **MCP-UI:** @mcp-ui/server v5.13.1

### Patterns
- **Tool responses:** Text tools return plain text, UI tools serialize JSON
- **Error handling:** TypeScript catches issues at compile time
- **Development:** Concurrently runs bridge + client together

---

## 🐛 Known Issues & Workarounds

### Issue 1: MCP Protocol Doesn't Support UI Resources Natively
**Problem:** Can't return `type: "resource"` in tool results
**Workaround:** Serialize as `UI_RESOURCE:{json}` in text field
**Status:** Working, but not ideal
**Future:** Investigate MCP Resources capability

### Issue 2: createUIResource API Differs from Docs
**Problem:** Returns `{resource: {text: "..."}}` not `{content: {iframeUrl: "..."}}`
**Workaround:** Updated client to use `resource.text` path
**Status:** Fixed
**Lesson:** Always test APIs, don't trust docs blindly

### Issue 3: No Bidirectional Communication Yet
**Problem:** UI can't trigger server actions (e.g., button clicks)
**Workaround:** Not needed for Phase 1-2
**Status:** To be solved in Phase 4
**Options:** PostMessage, callback URLs, WebSocket

## 📝 Quick Reference Commands

### Start Development
```bash
npm run dev                  # Start everything
```

### Build
```bash
npm run build:server        # Build server only
npm run build:client        # Build client only
npm run build               # Build both
```

### Run Individually
```bash
# Terminal 1
npm run dev:server --workspace=server

# Terminal 2
npm run bridge

# Terminal 3
npm run dev:client
```

### Troubleshooting
```bash
# Kill ports
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill
lsof -ti:3001 | xargs kill

# Clean rebuild
rm -rf server/build/ client/dist/ node_modules/
npm install
npm run build
```

## 🎓 Key Learnings So Far

### Technical
1. MCP uses stdio for communication (not HTTP)
2. Bridge pattern needed to connect stdio ↔ HTTP
3. TypeScript catches API mismatches early
4. Sandboxed iframes provide security isolation
5. npm workspaces simplify monorepo management

### Product
1. MCP-UI is an extension, not core protocol
2. Documentation often lags implementation
3. Pragmatic workarounds are acceptable for learning
4. Security should be default, not opt-in
5. Text vs UI is a spectrum, not binary

### Design
1. UI isn't always better than text
2. Context determines optimal interaction mode
3. Start simple, add complexity progressively
4. Small focused tools > monolithic ones

---

## 🚀 Next Session Plan

### Setup (5 minutes)
1. Pull latest code
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Verify http://localhost:3000 works
5. Review ARCHITECTURE.md and LEARNING_PLAN.md

### Phase 3 Kickoff (60-90 minutes)

#### Step 1: Define Data Model (15 min)
- Create `types.ts` for destination interfaces
- Define destination, itinerary, activity types
- Mock data structure planning

#### Step 2: Create Mock Data (20 min)
- `data/destinations.ts` with 10-15 destinations
- Various types: beach, mountain, city, cultural
- Include weather, cost, ratings, descriptions

#### Step 3: Implement search_destinations (30 min)
- Add tool to `server/src/index.ts`
- Implement search/filter logic
- Return formatted text results
- Test in browser

#### Step 4: Implement get_destination_info (20 min)
- Add tool for detailed destination lookup
- Format detailed information
- Test with various destinations

#### Step 5: Test & Refine (10 min)
- Test all tools together
- Fix any bugs
- Update documentation

### Success Criteria
- ✅ 3 working text-based tools
- ✅ Mock data for 10+ destinations
- ✅ Tools are testable in browser
- ✅ Code is clean and documented
- ✅ Ready for Phase 4 (UI components)
